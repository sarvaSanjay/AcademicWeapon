<h1>Introducing Academic Weapon: A Source of Student Inspiration</h1>

# Our Story 🌟
Within the heart of every student, there's a shared challenge: turning class notes into powerful study tools. We've been there, navigating the maze of traditional note-taking 📝, wrestling with digital tools like Evernote or OneNote that lack automation 🤖. We've felt the pain of inputting data manually into popular flashcard apps like Anki or Quizlet 🧠💡, and the frustration of crafting quizzes on platforms like Google Forms 📊. Even those pre-made study materials on SparkNotes and CliffsNotes don't always hit the mark for our specific coursework 📖❌.

In response, we harnessed the magic of GPT-3.5 to create Academic Weapon, a revolutionary tool. We've redefined the way you interact with your notes.

# What Academic Weapon Does 🚀
Your notes, whether they're digital or handwritten in PDFs, or even scanned from physical pages, are your canvas 🎨. Academic Weapon is the artist, effortlessly transforming your notes into a masterpiece of learning 📚. You'll have the choice to review your materials through captivating quizzes or dynamic flashcards. Get ready to experience a new dimension in studying! 🤯📝📊🔥

# How We Built It
We developed our app using a combination of technologies, including Microsoft Azure's OCR for extracting text from digital or handwritten notes. We used React and HTML/CSS to create an engaging user interface for interactive flashcards and quizzes. Additionally, we harnessed the power of ChatGPT-3.5 to generate content for our quizzes and flashcards. Last but not least, we savored the delightful taste of bubble tea!🍵💭
